          <h1>About Nihongo School</h1>
           <p>Nihongo School is a webpage that is intended for you to learn how to read Japanese</p>

           <p>The story behind the creation of this page is that after returning from Japan, I didn't really keep up with studies on my
               Japanese and forgot how to read a lot of the Kanji,
               <br></br>
               
                so I have been in search for a way where I can start over and practice them again.
               <br></br>
               <br></br>
               Since I am studying webbprogramming and got the opportunity to create my own webpage, I thought why not start here.
               <br></br> 
               At the same time
               I give myself two language to study at the same time(programming and Japanese) and I also create a way to introduce other people to Japanese.
               <br></br>
               <br></br>
               <br></br>
               <b>I hope this will be helpful for other people aswell and not just for me, and I hope I can get some to want to learn even more Japanese</b>
           </p>
